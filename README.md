## QUICKSTART

0. Make sure to use Node 16. [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is your friend
1. `yarn` to install all packages and dependencies
2. Create `.env` file in `./evm` based of `./evm/.env.example`
   > for now, the mnemonic is the most important since this is local)
3. run `yarn deploy` in `./evm` to deploy a local instance
   > You should/could see an updated `./evm/deployments/localhost` folder
4. Create `.env` file in `./app` based of `./app/env.local.example`
   > Use addresses from `./evm/deployments/localhost` in `./app/.env`
5. From root dir `./` run `yarn start`

`Yarn start` triggers, in order:

1. the smart contract test suite
2. typechain to provide the front end with typings for Quiver
3. `hardhat node` from `./evm/` instance for local evm chain
4. `yarn dev` from `./app` for local frontend on `localhost:3000`

Connect you wallet to RPC `http://localhost:8545/`

Changes to front-end will be live, changes to smart-contract code require restart

## DEVELOPMENT

#### Smart contracts

- Create or change smart contracts in `./emv/contracts/`
- Create or change test suites in `./evm/test/`
- Run `yarn test` from `./evm/`
  > This will also create types for the app and abis for the Graph

#### Front-end

- Create `./app/.env.local` from `./app/.env.local.template`
- Update `./app/hooks/`
- Create or change pages (and components) in `./app/pages/`

#### Run local

- Run `yarn start` from `./`
  > Runs smart contracts tests
  > Generates types for app and ABIs for Graph
  > Start local hardhat node (evm instance)
  > Start front-end app

To interact with the app, connect your wallet to local RPC `http://localhost:8485/`

#### Graph

In case you need more complex data objects, or want to reduce multiple get calls to the contract to a single database query, or whatever, you can use the Graph. This package runs a local instance of the Graph where you can deploy to and call the endpoint via your app. It requires `docker-compose`.

- Change and/or update `./graph/schema.graphql`
  > Define your entitites and relations
- Change and/or update `./graph/subgraph.yaml.ts`
  > Define the data sources
- Change and/or update `./graph/mapping.ts`

  > Define the data processing from events from source to entities and relations in schema

- Run `yarn start:local` from `./graph`
  > Create Docker-compose instance
- Run `yarn create:local` from `./graph`

Inspect your Graph on http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/summon/raid-app/graphql

For [unit testing the Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/unit-testing-framework/) we use [matchstick](https://github.com/LimeChain/matchstick)

#### Local integration

> If you're using the Graph open 2 terminals

- Run `yarn start` from `./`

  > Inspect app on localhost:3000
  > Remember to connect your wallet to RPC localhost:8545

- Run `yarn start:graph` from`./`
- When done, run `yarn stop:local` from `./graph` to clean up docker instance. If you don't do this, blocks will get out of sync and the next run will crash.

Play around with the interaction. The second derived address in your wallet is the owner of the token as you can see under ERC20

- Mint some tokens
- Stake portion of those tokens
- Claim rewards
- Mint NFTs
- Play around

Cool bonus: when you create a stake, that is registered by the Graph and displayed in the 'Latest stakes' card under Staking

## DEPLOYMENT - SMART CONTRACT

The used addresses for `deployer`, `owner` and `user` are configured in `./evm/hardhat.config.ts`. For local testing different addresses are used to validate the ownership or role-based modifiers.

- Update or add deployment scripts in `./evm/deploy/`
- Run `hardhat deploy` to validate the deployment
- Run `yarn hardhat --network [NETWORK_NAME_HERE] deploy`
  > Use a network configured in `./evm/hardhat.config.ts`
- Run `yarn hardhat --network [NETWORK_NAME_HERE] etherscan-verify` to verify the contracts on the relevant block explorer.

## DEPLOYMENT - APP

Check out Vercel

-[ ] Add in fleek.co deployment

## DEPLOYMENT - GRAPH

- Create subgraph entry in [Hosted Version Dashboard](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/dashboard)
- Update deploy script with subgraph name
- Run `yarn deploy` from `./graph`
